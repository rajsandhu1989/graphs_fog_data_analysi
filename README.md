# graphs_fog_data_analysis
This small code contains python code for developing histograms with multiple variables and pie charts using packages like matplotlib and seaborn. whenever I need to make graphs for my research paper experiments results, I often use this code to draw graphs which itself conculdes the results.

Output of graphs are:

![Image showing Trust values of various Fog Service Providers](trust_value_new.png)

![Variance in Trust calculated by various sources for a Fog Service Provider](var_new.png)

![Pie Chart distribution of final values assigned to the FSPs](trust_pie_chrt.png)
